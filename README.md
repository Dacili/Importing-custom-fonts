# Importing custom fonts in app
How to import custom font in your app?

### 1. Get font files
Firstly, you need to download the font files from somewhere (for example: https://fontsgeek.com/fonts/Basic-Sans-SF-Regular).  
Font **formats/extensions** are usually some of these:  ```OTF, TTF, WOFF, SVG, and EOF.```  
I will use **Basic Sans** font with **otf** extension. You can find them in files. 

### 2. Import them in app
Usually, you should put them in the ```assets -> fonts``` folder.

### 4. Import in the main styles.scss
